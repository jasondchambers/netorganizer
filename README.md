# Net Organizer
Network Organizer enables you to bring some order to the chaos that might be your network. It enables you to take inventory of active hosts and to neatly classify each of them taking care of fixed IP reservations. It can bring to your attention un-classified hosts that are actively on your network and invite you to classify them.
